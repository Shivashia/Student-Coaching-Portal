# Student-Coaching-Portal
Student Coaching Portal is a project developed by Shiv Avashia, Bhavik Bolya, Ananay Agarwal, and Samar Bansod. It gives a general, interactive experience of a website used by a programming based coaching class, "Valorant Coaching", which provides Python, R, and Java courses. The website has been created from scratch, and employs the usage of HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, to provide  multiple functionalities to the website. The functionalities of the website range from having a login for an admin or student, a dashboard for the student, a registration page for new admissions, and a homepage. Overall, the website/project is a virtually accurate representation of a website that would be implemented by a real-life coaching class.
